Hi
  This is regarding my visit as an Ayurvedic Consultant to Kama Store in GK. On my previous visits I had to keep standing there during whole visit as not even a stool was 
 provided to me during entire visit. This is very painful for me as I have already disclosed about my back issues earlier. It would not be possible for me to visit these 
stores which don't even have any sitting provision. I request you to kindly provide with a seating arrangement or give me any other store with one. According to my contract 
I am supposed to visit for a specified number of days. I am just asking to allot those days to the stores which don't have any medical consequence for me.
Also the contract says that the salary will be credited between 7th to 10th of every month. It's 15th today and still no sign or word from Kama when it actually will be credited.
I hope that you pay heed to these issues to make my tenure with Kama smooth and fruitful.
